# learning-js
commencement of my js journey.
Today I start my js journey i am planning to finish my basics in a few weeks and then to corroborate my success i will make 2 projects using Js the first one will be a little basic but ill make sure to end on a strong note and build a resume ready project
note: i am just starting my js journey so i will be uploading files with the most random stuff on it not only so i can document my journey but also to see the contrast of my skills in the days to come
please ignore the files with completely random code i.e random variables and operations i am just getting used to the language
